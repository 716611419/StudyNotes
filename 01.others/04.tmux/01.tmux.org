TMUX(1)                                                         BSD General Commands Manual                                                         TMUX(1)

NAME
     tmux — terminal multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
     tmux [-2CluvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name] [-S socket-path] [command [flags]]

DESCRIPTION
     tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be detached
     from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows infor‐
     mation on the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occu‐
     pies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(7) manual page documents the
     technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present in the
     same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’
     key strokes).  tmux may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a single server.  The server and each client are separate pro‐
     cesses which communicate through a socket in /tmp.

     The options are as follows:

     -2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     -C            Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section).  Given twice (-CC) disables echo.

     -c shell-command
                   Execute shell-command using the default shell.  If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.
                   This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.

     -f file       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then
                   looks for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.

    -L socket-name
                   tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR, TMPDIR if it is unset, or /tmp if both are unset.  The default socket is
                   named default.  This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run.  Unlike
                   -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it (note that this will
                   fail if any parent directories are missing).

     -l            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     -S socket-path
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is
                   ignored.

     -u            tmux attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment
                   variables to be set for the string "UTF-8".  This is not always correct: the -u flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.

                   If the server is started from a client passed -u or where UTF-8 is detected, the utf8 and status-utf8 options are enabled in the global
                   window and session options respectively.

     -v            Request verbose logging.  This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.  Log messages will be saved into
                   tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.

     -V            Report the tmux version.

     command [flags]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified, the
                   new-session command is assumed.
KEY BINDINGS
     tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.
           $           Rename the current session.
           %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.
           &           Kill the current window.
           '           Prompt for a window index to select.
           (           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
           )           Switch the attached client to the next session.
           ,           Rename the current window.
           -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
           .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
           0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
           :           Enter the tmux command prompt.
           ;           Move to the previously active pane.
           =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
           ?           List all key bindings.
           D           Choose a client to detach.
           L           Switch the attached client back to the last session.
           [           Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
           ]           Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.
           c           Create a new window.
           d           Detach the current client.
